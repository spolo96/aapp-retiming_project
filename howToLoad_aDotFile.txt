In order for a .DOT file to be properly loaded into the command tool, it has to follow this specific example: 

digraph g {
    forcelabels=true;
    a [label="0", xlabel="0"];
    b [label="1", xlabel="3"];
    c [label="2", xlabel="3"];
    d [label="3", xlabel="7"];
    a-> b[weight="2"];
    b->c[weight="0"];
    b->d[weight="0"];
    c->d[weight="0"];
    d->a[weight="0"];
}

Where "xlabel" would be the propagation delay assigned to the specific index. 

After creating the .DOT file, we need to hardcode and put the name of the file we created in customGraph method from RetimingProject_Colabversion so we can perform operations like OPT1 and OPT2 inside it.
