# 
# Problem: Optimize frequency of a circuit
# 
# Solutions: 
# Move register(s) so that:
# 	- clock cycle decreases or number of registers decreases.
# 	- input-output behavior is preserved.

# # Retiming Graph Example

#Example taken from: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~keutzer/classes/244fa2005/lectures/8-2-retiming-ucb.pdf and

# # Implemented Algorithms

# ## Graph Generators
# 
# ## Restrictions on Graph Generation
# In order that a graph G = (V, E, d, w) have well-defined physical meaning
# as a circuit, we place nonnegativity restrictions on the propagation delays
# d(v) and the register counts w(e):
# 
# D1. The propagation delay d(v) is nonnegative for each vertex v belonging to V.
# 
# W1. The register count w(e) is a nonnegative integer for each edge e belonging to E.
# We also impose the restriction that there be no directed cycles of zero weight:
# 
# W2. In any directed cycle of G, there is some edge with (strictly) positive
# register count.

# # Algorithm Execution
# 
# Since any algorithm just needs as input the graph (with the exception of FEAS that need the graph and a clock period c), we can execute the specific algorithm need with a simple function with a graph that has to be already created.
